      description: 'Complete your first book',
      criteria: { books_completed: 1 },
      points: 100,
      badge: 'first_book.svg',
    },
    {
      id: 'speed_reader',
      name: 'Speed Reader',
      description: 'Read 5 books in one month',
      criteria: { books_per_month: 5 },
      points: 500,
      badge: 'speed_reader.svg',
    },
    {
      id: 'quiz_master',
      name: 'Quiz Master',
      description: 'Score 100% on 10 quizzes',
      criteria: { perfect_quizzes: 10 },
      points: 300,
      badge: 'quiz_master.svg',
    },
    // ... more achievements
  ];

  static async checkAchievements(userId: string, activityType: string, activityData: any) {
    const userStats = await this.getUserStats(userId);
    const newAchievements = [];

    for (const rule of this.ACHIEVEMENT_RULES) {
      const hasAchievement = await this.userHasAchievement(userId, rule.id);
      if (!hasAchievement && this.meetsAchievementCriteria(rule, userStats, activityData)) {
        await this.awardAchievement(userId, rule.id);
        newAchievements.push(rule);
      }
    }

    return newAchievements;
  }

  private static meetsAchievementCriteria(rule: any, userStats: any, activityData: any): boolean {
    // Implement achievement criteria checking logic
    return false;
  }

  private static async awardAchievement(userId: string, achievementId: string) {
    // Award achievement and points to user
    await db.user_achievements.create({
      data: {
        user_id: userId,
        achievement_id: achievementId,
        earned_at: new Date(),
      },
